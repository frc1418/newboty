# Newboty Practice Bot Code

> Code for the 2019 Practice Bot

## Controls
We used a one-joystick control system for sake of convenience. Moving the joystick on the Y axis moves the robot forwards or backwards, and the X axis causes it to rotate.

#### Correcting Joystick Axis
The joystick we used is unique in that the origin, (0,0), is the bottom right of the joystick, rather than the center. To account for this, we had to make some corrections to the joystick input.
